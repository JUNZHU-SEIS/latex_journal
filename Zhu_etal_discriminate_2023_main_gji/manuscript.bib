Here, we employ a state‐of‐the‐art neural network infused with an attention mechanism to simultaneously pick arrivals and determine the first‐motion polarity. The model is trained and tested with data from southern California. Compared with polarity inference with manual picks in the catalog, predicted polarity inference can help obtain more focal mechanism solutions in southern California. We test this model with data from different regions and observe high generalizability. The predicted arrival and polarity data are consistent with the labeled arrival and polarity data in Japan. The average‐picking error is 0.04 s, and the accuracy of polarity classification is 99\\%. We infer the focal mechanisms from the predicted polarity in Oklahoma. The derived focal mechanisms are consistent with referencing focal mechanisms. This method allows routinely obtaining arrival and polarity data, and deriving focal mechanism solutions for events.}",

	abstract = {This paper presents a fully automatic method for seismic event classification within a sparse regional seismograph network. The method is based on a supervised pattern recognition technique called the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification relies on differences in signal energy distribution between natural and artificial seismic sources. We filtered seismic records via 20 narrow band-pass filters and divided them into four phase windows: P, P coda, S, and S coda. We then computed a short-term average (STA) value for each filter channel and phase window. The 80 discrimination parameters served as a training model for the SVM. We calculated station specific SVM models for 19 on-line seismic stations in Finland. The training data set included 918 positive (earthquake) and 3469 negative (non-earthquake) examples. An independent test period determined method and rules for integrating station-specific classification results into network results. Finally, we applied the network classification rules to independent evaluation data comprising 5435 fully automatic event determinations, 5404 of which had been manually identified as explosions or noise, and 31 as earthquakes. The SVM method correctly identified 94\% of the non-earthquakes and all but one of the earthquakes. The result implies that the SVM tool can identify and filter out blasts and spurious events from fully automatic event solutions with a high level of accuracy. The tool helps to reduce the work-load and costs of manual seismic analysis by leaving only a small fraction of automatic event determinations, the probable earthquakes, for more detailed seismological analysis. The self-learning approach presented here is flexible and easily adjustable to the requirements of a denser or wider high-frequency network.},

We use vertical component seismograms from 440 earthquakes and 450 quarry explosions with MD 1.5 to 3.3 to calculate source parameters, including scalar moments and corner frequencies. The Mo(P,S) vs. fc(P,S) and P- to S-wave corner frequency fc(P)/fc(S) ratios are used to distinguish quarry blasts from earthquakes. A comparison of Mo(P,S) vs. fc(P,S) for both earthquakes and explosions in Egypt demonstrates that explosions had signiﬁcantly lower corner frequencies than earthquakes, particularly for S-wave displacement spectra. In contrast to the Northern and Central regions, the Southern Egyptian region provides a perfect separation of corner frequencies of earthquakes and explosions for both P- and S-waves. The empirically derived average ratio of fc(P)/fc(S) for earthquakes is 1.28, 1.26 and 1.26 in the Northern, Central and Southern Egyptian regions, respectively. For explosions, average fc(P)/fc(S) ratios are 1.89, 1.86 and 2.0 in the three Egyptian regions, respectively. According to these ﬁndings, the average ratio of fc(P) to fc(S) for explosions is higher than those for earthquakes, implying that the differences in ratios enhance the ability of the fc(P) vs. fc(S) approach to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions. Based on the average fc(P)/ fc(S) ratios vs. Mw in the whole of Egypt, the observed fc(P)/ fc(S) discrimination threshold value for separating quarry explosions from earthquakes is 1.51–1.52.},

These methods are generally successful for large seismic events (M\\&gt;3–4) well recorded at regional‐to‐teleseismic distances (\\&gt;150  km); however, it is unclear whether they can be modified to work for small events (M\\&lt;3) well recorded only at local distances (\\&lt;150  km). Here, we evaluate a recently proposed, local‐distance seismic source discriminant—the difference between local magnitude (ML) and coda duration magnitude (MC)—using seismograms of earthquakes and buried, single‐fired chemical explosions recorded in three regions of the western United States. The quantity ML–MC was previously found to be sensitive to source depth, effectively discriminating mine blasts, induced earthquakes, and very shallow tectonic earthquakes from deeper crustal earthquakes. In this study, we report the first evaluation of ML–MC as a depth discriminant using data from buried, single‐fired explosions that, unlike the seismic sources studied earlier, are good analogs for underground nuclear explosions. We find that even when using generic, uncalibrated methods of assigning magnitudes, ML–MC separates single‐fired explosions and earthquakes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.92 for 19 explosions and 14 earthquakes in Washington, 0.90 for 22 explosions and 90 earthquakes in Wyoming, and 0.99 for three explosions and 149 earthquakes in Nevada. ML:MC comparisons have the potential to enhance discrimination based on high‐frequency P/S amplitudes ratios—which perform less well at local than regional distances—because the two metrics have complementary sensitivities.}",

For 6846 well-located earthquakes in the Utah region, we find that ML-MC is on average 0.44 magnitude units smaller for mining-induced seismicity (MIS) than for tectonic seismicity (TS). Our interpretation of this observation is that MIS occurs within near-surface low-velocity layers that act as a waveguide and preferentially increase coda duration relative to peak amplitude, while the vast majority of TS occurs beneath the near-surface waveguide. A second data set of 3723 confirmed or probable explosions in the Utah region also has significantly lower ML-MC values than TS, likely for the same reason as the MIS. These observations suggest that ML-MC is useful as a depth indicator and could discriminate small explosions and mining-induced earthquakes from deeper, naturally occurring earthquakes at local-to-regional distances.},

The shot time is determined up to 10 msec by using a disposable pick-up placed directly on the explosive. About 17 permanent stations and 20 temporary stations are used for the recordings. With a fast paper speed (typically 1 cm/sec) and the WWVB radio signals superposed on the seismictrace, absolute timing accuracy of up to 10 msec is achieved. A representative structure thus determinedconsistsof a 4 km thick 5.5 km/seclayer underlain successively by 23.4 km thick 6.3 km/sec layer, 5.0 km thick 6.8 km/sec layer and 7.8 km/sec half space. The details of the lower crust are somewhat uncertain. This structure can explain the travel time data, corrected for the station and source elevations and for the station delays, to +0.15 sec. Small but systematic temporal velocitychanges up to 3{\textasciitilde} have been found for some of the profiles. If the effect of the migration of the shot point is small enough, these changes are larger than experimental errors and represent real temporal change in the material property between the shot point and the stations.},

    abstract = "{In support of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we have started to evaluate regional seismic-event discrimination capabilities for central Asia, emphasizing western China. We have measured noise and signal levels of over 260 earthquakes and 26 underground nuclear explosions recorded at the broadband, digital station WMQ in western China and over 120 earthquakes and five nuclear explosions at station AAK in Kyrgyzstan. The explosions are from the Kazakh Test Site (KTS) and Lop Nor, China. The earthquakes are mostly from northwest China. Event magnitudes (measured as either mb or ML) range between 2.5 and 6.5 and maximum event-station distance is about 1700 km. We formed phase, spectral, cross-spectral, short-period/long-period, and long-period ratios to test many possible event discriminants. All ratios were corrected for distance effects before forming ratio-versus-magnitude discrimination plots.The most consistent discriminants for separating earthquakes from explosions are P/S phase ratios for frequencies above 3 to 4 Hz. P-wave (f \\&gt; 1 Hz) to Rayleigh-wave (0.03 Hz \\&lt; f \\&lt; 0.1 Hz) ratios are also effective, but surface-waves are difficult to measure for magnitudes below about 4.5. For the P/S ratios, separation between earthquakes and explosions increases with frequency, and for the P/R ratios, separation increases with increasing P frequency. The P (3 to 6 Hz)/S (0.75 to 1.5 Hz) cross-spectral ratios also separate earthquakes and explosions. These cross-spectral ratios may prove quite useful because, due to weak high-frequency Lg signals from explosions, the high-frequency P/Lg ratio sometimes cannot be evaluated, but the P (3 to 6 Hz)/Lg (0.75 to 1.5 Hz) can be evaluated successfully.P spectral ratios (3 to 6 Hz/0.75 to 1.5 Hz) also separate earthquakes and explosions but not quite as consistently as the P/S ratios. However, P spectral ratios may prove useful in cases where path effects block or highly attenuate Sn and Lg waves, rendering the P/S ratios unavailable. In contrast to Nevada Test Site (NTS) events, the Lg (3 to 6 Hz/0.75 to 1.5 Hz) spectral ratio does not separate earthquakes and nuclear explosions in central Asia. This observation may be a source effect, as Asian explosions are thought to be detonated in highly lithified rocks below the water table, while most of the smaller (mb \\&lt; 4.8) NTS explosions have been detonated in poorly lithified rocks above the water table.For station AAK, the short-period spectral and cross-spectral ratios identify a few earthquakes (not recorded at WMQ) from the north Pamir region that plot with the Lop Nor explosions. The waveforms from these earthquakes lack surface waves and a distinct Lg phase. These events, which we interpret as having occurred in a subducted slab, do separate from the explosions on high-frequency (f \\&gt; 4 Hz) P/S discrimination plots. For station WMQ, long-period R/L (Rayleigh-wave/Love-wave) ratios separate KTS explosions and Asian earthquakes. However, R/L ratios fail to identify the large Lop Nor explosions recorded at station AAK because the Love waves are as large as the Rayleigh waves, suggesting that strong tectonic release occurs with these explosions. Because we have examined only one path at a single station for these explosions, source-radiation pattern may be influencing this observation.}",

    abstract = "{Travel-time data obtained from both natural and artificial events occurring in southern California indicate a major, lateral crustal transition within the Transverse Range Province. The eastern crust is very similar to the adjacent Mojave region, where a crustal velocity of 6.2 km/sec is typically observed. The western ranges are dominated by an extensive 6.7 km/sec layer. Pn velocity beneath the western Mojave, Transverse Ranges, and northern Peninsular Ranges is 7.8 km/sec. The crustal thickness of these provinces is 30 to 35 km. The Transverse Ranges do not have a distinct crustal root. Unlike other provinces within southern California, the Transverse Ranges are underlain at a depth of 40 km by a refractor with a P-velocity of 8.3 km/sec. P-delays from a vertically incident, well-recorded teleseism suggest that this velocity anomaly extends to a depth of 100 km. These data indicate that this high-velocity, ridge-like structure is coincident with much of the areal extent of the geomorphic Transverse Ranges and is not offset by the San Andreas fault. Four hypotheses are advanced to explain the continuity of this feature across the plate boundary: (1) dynamic phase change; (2) a coincidental alignment of crust or mantle anomalies; (3) the litho-sphere is restricted to the crust; (4) the plate boundary at depth is displaced from the San Andreas fault at the surface. Within the context of the last model, we suggest the plate boundary at depth is at the eastern end of the velocity anomaly, in the vicinity of the active Helendale-Lenwood-Camprock faults. The regionally observed 7.8 km/sec layer is suggested as a zone of decoupling necessary to accommodate the horizontal shear that must result from the divergence of the crust and upper mantle plate boundaries. The geomorphic Transverse Ranges are viewed as crustal buckling caused by the enhanced coupling between the crust and upper mantle which is suggested by the locally thin, 7.8 km/sec layer.}",

            Urban seismology has become an active research field in the recent years, both with seismological objectives, as obtaining better microzonation maps in highly populated areas, and with engineering objectives, as the monitoring of traffic or the surveying of historical buildings. We analyze here the seismic records obtained by a broad-band seismic station installed in the ICTJA-CSIC institute, located near the center of Barcelona city. Although this station was installed to introduce visitors to earth science during science fairs and other dissemination events, the analysis of the data has allowed to infer results of interest for the scientific community. The main results include the evidence that urban seismometers can be used as a easy-to-use, robust monitoring tool for road traffic and subway activity inside the city. Seismic signals generated by different cultural activities, including rock concerts, fireworks or football games, can be detected and discriminated from its seismic properties. Beside the interest to understand the propagation of seismic waves generated by those rather particular sources, those earth shaking records provide a powerful tool to gain visibility in the mass media and hence have the opportunity to present earth sciences to a wider audience.},

The package takes advantage of the growing number of Python libraries including Obspy. All the data formats supported by Obspy can be supported within the PhasePApy. The PhasePApy has two subpackages: the PhasePicker and the Associator, aiming to identify phase arrival onsets and associate them to phase types, respectively. The PhasePicker and the Associator can work jointly or separately. Three autopickers are implemented in the PhasePicker subpackage: the frequency‐band picker, the Akaike information criteria function derivative picker, and the kurtosis picker. All three autopickers identify picks with the same processing methods but different characteristic functions. The PhasePicker triggers the pick with a dynamic threshold and can declare a pick with false‐pick filtering. Also, the PhasePicker identifies a pick polarity and uncertainty for further seismological analysis, such as focal mechanism determination. Two associators are included in the Associator subpackage: the 1D Associator and 3D Associator, which assign phase types to picks that can best fit potential earthquakes by minimizing root mean square (rms) residuals of the misfits in distance and time, respectively. The Associator processes multiple picks from all channels at a seismic station and aggregates them to increase computational efficiencies. Both associators use travel‐time look up tables to determine the best estimation of the earthquake location and evaluate the phase type for picks. The PhasePApy package has been used extensively for local and regional earthquakes and can work for active source experiments as well.}",

abstract = {Abstract The important task of tracking seismic activity requires both sensitive detection and accurate earthquake location. Approximate earthquake locations can be estimated promptly and automatically; however, accurate locations depend on precise seismic phase picking, which is a laborious and time-consuming task. We adapted a deep neural network (DNN) phase picker trained on local seismic data to mesoscale hydraulic fracturing experiments. We designed a novel workflow, transfer learning-aided double-difference tomography, to overcome the 3 orders of magnitude difference in both spatial and temporal scales between our data and data used to train the original DNN. Only 3,500 seismograms (0.45\% of the original DNN data) were needed to retrain the original DNN model successfully. The phase picks obtained with transfer-learned model are at least as accurate as the analyst's and lead to improved event locations. Moreover, the effort required for picking once the DNN is trained is a small fraction of the analyst's.},

The oil and gas potential of a formation deep in the trough, the Rogersville shale, which is ∼1  km above Precambrian basement, is being tested in eastern Kentucky. Because induced seismicity can occur from fracking formations in close proximity to basement, a temporary seismic network was deployed along the trend of the Rome trough from June 2015 through May 2019 to characterize natural seismicity.Using empirical noise models and theoretical Brune sources, minimum detectable magnitudes, Mmin, were estimated in the study area. The temporary stations reduced Mmin by an estimated 0.3–0.8 magnitude units in the vicinity of wastewater‐injection wells and deep oil and gas wells testing the Rogersville shale. The first 3 yr of seismicity detected and located in the study area has been compiled. Consistent with the long‐term seismicity patterns in the Advanced National Seismic System Comprehensive Catalog, very few earthquakes occurred in the crust beneath the Rome trough—only three events were recorded—where the temporary network was most sensitive. None of these events appear to have been associated with Rogersville shale oil and gas test wells. Outside of the trough boundary faults, earthquakes are diffusely distributed in zones extending into southern Ohio to the north, and into the eastern Tennessee seismic zone to the south. The orientations of P axes from the seven first‐motion focal mechanisms determined in this study are nearly parallel with both the trend of the Rome trough and with the orientation of maximum horizontal compressive stress in the region. This apparent alignment between the regional stress field and the strikes of faults in the trough at seismogenic depths may explain the relative lack of earthquake activity in the trough compared with the surrounding crust to the north and south.}",

Murphy and Bennett, 1982) which indicated that spectral differences in short-period regional phases may be diagnostic of source type for Nevada Test Site (NTS) explosions and nearby earthquakes recorded at Tonto Forest Observatory in Arizona. Regional phase signals from two additional stations, the Uinta Basin Observatory array in Utah and the Blue Mountains Observatory array in Oregon, and from supplemental events, including aftershocks of the 1966 Caliente, Nevada, earthquake, have been analyzed. These stations are at epicentral distances of 430 to 530 km for Tonto Forest Observatory, 520 to 670 km for Uinta Basin Observatory, and 870 to 880 km for Blue Mountains Observatory, with the near ranges representing the distances to the Caliente source area and the far ranges to the average NTS source/receiver distances. This enhanced data base included 50 earthquakes within about 150 km of NTS and 35 NTS explosions recorded at one or more stations. The events cover a magnitude range from about 2.8 to 5.2 (mb), with the majority of earthquakes concentrated in the lower half of that range.The current investigation essentially corroborated our previous findings that comparison of simple, peak-amplitude measurements of regional P and Lg phases did not consistently discriminate between earthquakes and explosions. This discriminant breakdown appears to be related to variability in excitation of regional phases from similar sources which has been dramatically illustrated by observations from the 1966 Caliente aftershocks; these events produced large variations in the relative amplitudes of Pg and Lg signals even though the events were spatially restricted to a small zone. In contrast, the Lg spectral ratio discriminant measure, defined in the previous study, continued to provide reliable distinction between the earthquake and explosion sources for data observed at all three stations. The discrimination capability of the spectral ratio prevails in spite of the evident mechanism variability between earthquakes and shifts in the discrimination threshold between stations apparently related to attenuation differences along the propagation paths.}",

Here we present the first example of such a rapid-response experiment using four telecommunication fiber optic cables near the 2019 M 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake in California. By applying template matching to the Ridgecrest DAS array, we detected 6 times more aftershocks than the standard catalog within the three-month period. The enhanced catalog reveals abundant aftershocks on multiple crosscutting faults near the epicenters of the mainshock and the M 6.4 foreshock. Given the widespread fiber optic networks around the world, DAS has the potential to deliver fast and high-resolution aftershock monitoring and promote better understanding of earthquake physics.},

	abstract = {Earthquake early warning (EEW) is a relatively new strategy for reducing disaster risk and increasing resilience to seismic hazard in urban settings. EEW systems provide real-time information about ongoing earthquakes, enabling individuals, communities, governments, businesses and others located at distance to take timely action to reduce the probability of harm or loss before the earthquake-induced ground shaking reaches them. Examples of potential losses mitigated by EEW systems include injuries and infrastructure downtime. These systems are currently operating in nine countries, and are being/have been tested for implementation in 13 more. This paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to EEW around the world. We specifically focus on the various algorithms that have been developed for the rapid calculation of seismic-source parameters, ground shaking, and potential consequences in the wake of an event. We also discuss limitations of the existing applied methodologies, with a particular emphasis on the lack of engineering-related (i.e., risk and resilience) metrics currently used to support decision-making related to the triggering of alerts by various end users. Finally, we provide a number of suggestions for future end-user-orientated advances in the field of EEW. For example, we propose that next-generation EEW systems should incorporate engineering-based, application-specific models/tools for more effective risk communication. They should operate within robust probabilistic frameworks that explicitly quantify uncertainties at each stage of the analysis, for more informed stakeholder decision-making. These types of advancements in EEW systems would represent an important paradigm shift in current approaches to issuing early warnings for natural hazards.},

Using a contaminated dataset reduces the statistical significance of results and can lead to erroneous conclusions, thus the removal of such nonnatural events should be the first step for a data analyst. Blasts misclassified as natural earthquakes, indeed, may artificially alter the seismicity rates and then the b‐value of the Gutenberg and Richter relationship, an essential ingredient of several forecasting models.At present, datasets collect useful information beyond the parameters to locate the earthquakes in space and time, allowing the users to discriminate between natural and nonnatural events. However, selecting them from webservices queries is neither easy nor clear, and part of such supplementary but fundamental information can be lost during downloading. As a consequence, most of statistical seismologists ignore the presence in seismic catalog of explosions and quarry blasts and assume that they were not located by seismic networks or in case they were eliminated.We here show the example of the Italian Seismological Instrumental and Parametric Database.

	abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

The ability of deep learning models to generalize beyond the training and validation data is important for comprehensive earthquake monitoring; this ability furthermore depends on the availability of a sufficiently large and complete training dataset. However, this requirement can prove challenging to meet due to significant effort and time for data collection and labeling. Data augmentation provides an efficient and effective approach for increasing the dimension of training samples and improving generalization to unseen samples. In this paper, we present augmentation methods appropriate for seismic waveforms and demonstrate their ability to reduce bias and increase performance.

	abstract = {As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difﬁcult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difﬁcult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called “PhaseNet” that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufﬁcient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.},

SVM classiﬁers are derived based on discriminant features of a training data set consisting of 1,400 TEs selected from the aftershock sequences of 18 ML ≥ 5.0 earthquakes, 2,881 QBs from repeating events occurring in those areas with a percentage of event daytime occurrence greater than 0.9, and 987 IEs from events in the known oil/gas ﬁelds and water reservoirs. The discriminant features include spectral amplitudes of observed P and S wave signals in a frequency range of 1–15 Hz normalized by the P spectrum and averaged over the entire seismic network, and an optional feature of the percentage of event daytime occurrence. Statistics analyses indicate that the accuracies of the SVM classiﬁers are 99.81\% for TEs, 99.93\% for QBs, and 99.62\% for IEs. Our classiﬁcation indicates that 37.57\% of the seismic events are QBs occurring in possible mine areas and appearing mostly as clusters with a percentage of event daytime occurrence greater than 0.9, 50.12\% are TEs occurring in various thrust faults in the Tianshan orogenic belt, and 12.31\% are IEs or shallow tectonic earthquakes occurring mostly as clusters near oil and gas ﬁelds and water reservoirs. We reevaluate b values in the region and obtain relatively uniform values for the classiﬁed TEs with most of them below 1.0, as opposed to a large range of values (0.5–2.7) when all the seismic events are used in the analysis.},

Here we train convolutional neural networks to measure both quantities, which learn directly from seismograms without the need for feature extraction. The networks are trained on 18.2 million manually picked seismograms for the Southern California region. Through cross validation on 1.2 million independent seismograms, the differences between the automated and manual picks have a standard deviation of 0.023 s. The polarities determined by the classifier have a precision of 95\% when compared with analyst-determined polarities. We show that the classifier picks more polarities overall than the analysts, without sacrificing quality, resulting in almost double the number of focal mechanisms. The remarkable precision of the trained networks indicates that they can perform as well, or better, than expert seismologists.},

abstract = {Transfer learning as a new machine learning paradigm has gained increasing attention lately. In situations where the training data in a target domain are not sufficient to learn predictive models effectively, transfer learning leverages auxiliary source data from other related source domains for learning. While most of the existing works in this area only focused on using the source data with the same structure as the target data, in this paper, we push this boundary further by proposing a heterogeneous transfer learning framework for knowledge transfer between text and images. We observe that for a target-domain classification problem, some annotated images can be found on many social Web sites, which can serve as a bridge to transfer knowledge from the abundant text documents available over the Web. A key question is how to effectively transfer the knowledge in the source data even though the text can be arbitrarily found. Our solution is to enrich the representation of the target images with semantic concepts extracted from the auxiliary source data through a novel matrix factorization method. By using the latent semantic features generated by the auxiliary data, we are able to build a better integrated image classifier. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on the Caltech-256 image dataset.},

The metrics use different parts of the high-frequency wavefield and exhibit complementary sensitivity for classification of M ∼ 0.5–4 natural earthquakes and borehole explosions, which are the best analog for underground nuclear explosions. Using means from bootstrap resampling across four diverse geologic settings, joint classification achieves {\textgreater}94.4\% true positives and {\textless}8.4\% false positives when using ≥8 seismographs within 200 km of the source.

	abstract = {Explosions and earthquakes are effectively discriminated by P/S amplitude ratios for moderate magnitude events (M ≥ 4) observed at regional to teleseismic distances (≥200 km). It is less clear if P/S ratios are effective explosion discriminants for lower magnitudes observed at shorter distances. We report new tests of P/S discrimination using a dense seismic array in a continental volcanic arc setting near Mount St. Helens, with 23 single‐ﬁred borehole explosions (ML 0.9–2.3) and 406 earthquakes (ML 1–3.3). The array provides up to 95 three‐component broadband seismographs, and most source‐receiver distances are {\textless}120 km. Additional insight is provided by {\textasciitilde}3,000 vertical component geophone recordings of each explosion. Potential controls on local distance P/S ratios are investigated, including frequency range, distance, magnitude, source depth, number of seismographs, and site effects. A frequency band of about 10–18 Hz performs better than lower or narrower bands because explosion‐induced S wave amplitudes diminish relative to P for higher frequencies. Source depth and magnitude exhibited weak inﬂuences on P/S ratios. Site responses for earthquakes and explosions are correlated with each other and with shallow crustal Vp and Vs from traveltime tomography. Overall, the results indicate high potential for local distance P/S explosion discrimination in a continental volcanic arc setting, with ≥98\% true positives and ≤6.3\% false positives when using the array median from ≥16 stations. Performance is reduced for smaller arrays, especially those with ≤4 stations, thereby emphasizing the importance of array data for discrimination of low magnitude explosions. Plain Language Summary Methods to remotely classify seismic sources as either shear‐slip earthquakes or shallow subsurface explosions are important geophysical tools. They are used for investigations of anthropogenic processes such as underground nuclear explosion tests and mining activity as well as to obtain pure catalogs of tectonic and volcanic earthquakes. The ratio of compressional (P) wave amplitude to shear (S) wave amplitude is effective for classifying large earthquakes and explosions observed hundreds to thousands of kilometers away. Application of such methods at local distances is a topic of growing interest because smaller magnitude sources are only observed at close distances. We tested inﬂuences on P/S amplitude ratios and their effectiveness for source discrimination using a data set of tectonic and volcanic earthquakes and controlled shallow borehole explosions near Mount St. Helens. Most observations were within 120 km. We found that use of high frequencies and array‐median statistics is largely effective for source discrimination in this setting, successfully classifying 100\% of explosions while falsely attributing about 5\% of earthquakes to explosions. Variability of P/S ratios across the seismic array has a highly similar pattern for explosions and earthquakes and that pattern appears to be controlled by the seismic velocity structure of the shallow crust.},

We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers.

	abstract = {Short-period fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves (Rg) are commonly observed on seismograms of anthropogenic seismic events and shallow, naturally occurring tectonic earthquakes (TEs) recorded at local distances. In the Utah region, strong Rg waves traveling with an average group velocity of about 1:8 km=s are observed at ∼1 Hz on waveforms from shallow events (depth {\textless} 10 km) recorded at distances up to about 150 km. At these distances, Sg waves, which are direct shear waves traveling in the upper crust, are generally the dominant signals for TEs. In this study, we leverage the well-known notion that Rg amplitude decreases dramatically with increasing event depth to propose a new depth discriminant based on Rg-to-Sg spectral amplitude ratios. The approach is successfully used to discriminate shallow events (both earthquakes and anthropogenic events) from deeper TEs in the Utah region recorded at local distances ({\textless} 150 km) by the University of Utah Seismographic Stations (UUSS) regional seismic network. Using Mood’s median test, we obtained probabilities of nearly zero that the median Rg-to-Sg spectral amplitude ratios are the same between shallow events on the one hand (including both shallow TEs and anthropogenic events), and deeper earthquakes on the other, suggesting that there is a statistically significant difference in the estimated Rg-to-Sg ratios between the two populations. We also observed consistent disparities between the different types of shallow events (e.g., mining blasts vs. mining-induced earthquakes), implying that it may be possible to separate the subpopulations that make up this group. This suggests that using local distance Rg-to-Sg spectral amplitude ratios one can not only discriminate shallow events from deeper events but may also be able to discriminate among different populations of shallow events.},

	abstract = {A new quarry blast-earthquake discrimination method is presented based on the analysis of seismic coda waves. Quarry blasts and local earthquakes in the area encompassing the south-central Mojave Desert and Eastern Transverse Ranges were used to test this method. We found that the coda decay rate Qc−1 is significantly higher for quarry blasts than earthquakes for lower frequencies (1.5 and 3 Hz) for lapse time up to about 30 sec. This result is attributed to the greater contribution of surface waves to quarry blasts due to the shallowness of their source depth. The difference in Qc−1, however, disappears for lapse time greater than 30 sec for the same frequency range as well as for higher frequencies (6 and 12 Hz) for lapse time greater than 20 sec. This suggests that the coda waves, at the lapse time greater than these critical values, are dominated by the same type of body waves, probably S waves, for both quarry blasts and earthquakes. The power spectrum P0(ω) obtained after the correction for attenuation was compared between earthquakes and quarry blasts at the same stations, and a significant difference was found in the spectral shape between these two data sets. The curves of power spectrum P0(ω) versus frequency for quarry blasts decrease more sharply than for earthquakes at high frequencies, indicating a lack of energy in high frequencies for quarry blasts as compared to earthquakes. The different frequency dependence of power spectrum P0(ω) between quarry blasts and earthquakes is attributed to their different source properties and can be used for seismic discrimination of quarry blasts from earthquakes.},

However, many less studied regions lack a significant amount of labeled events needed for traditional CNN approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN-based Phase-Identification Classifier (CPIC) designed for phase detection and picking on small to medium sized training datasets. When trained on 30,146 labeled phases and applied to one-month of continuous recordings during the aftershock sequences of the 2008 MW 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China, CPIC detects 97.5\% of the manually picked phases in the standard catalog and predicts their arrival times with a five-times improvement over the ObsPy AR picker. In addition, unlike other CNN-based approaches that require millions of training samples, when the off-line training set size of CPIC is reduced to only a few thousand training samples the accuracy stays above 95\%. The deployment of CPIC takes less than 12 h to pick arrivals in 31-day recordings on 14 stations. In addition to the catalog phases manually picked by analysts, CPIC finds more phases for existing events and new events missed in the catalog. Among those additional detections, some are confirmed by a matched filter method while others require further investigation. Finally, when tested on a small dataset from a different region (Oklahoma, US), CPIC achieves 97\% accuracy after fine tuning only the fully connected layer of the model. This result suggests that the CPIC developed in this study can be used to identify and pick P/S arrivals in other regions with no or minimum labeled phases.},

The proposed method contains two branches: a deep learning branch operating directly on seismic waveforms or spectrograms, and a second branch operating on physics-based parametric features. These features are high-frequency P/S amplitude ratios and the difference between local magnitude (ML) and coda duration magnitude (MC). The combination achieves better generalization performance when applied to new regions than models that are developed solely with deep learning. We also examined which parts of the waveform data dominate deep learning decisions (i.e., via Grad-CAM). Such visualization provides a window into the black-box nature of the machine-learning models and offers new insight into how the deep learning derived models use data to make decisions.},

abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

abstract = {The International Monitoring System (IMS) being constructed in support of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty introduces new opportunities to nuclear test monitoring by providing open access to global data from seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasonic, and radionuclide sensors. These sensors will detect myriad natural and man-made events and can be used to identify those that have explosive characteristics and therefore might be clandestine nuclear tests. Detection and identification of seismic events must be conducted at a lower magnitude threshold (mb = 3.5 and lower) than has been previously considered. Concomitant with the lower monitoring threshold will be an increased number of events that must be scrutinized. This collection will be largely composed of regional observations in which the seismic waves have traversed complex geological structures. High-fidelity regional, geophysical models will be needed to support accurate location and source identification. Source identification will not be limited to the separation of single-fired nuclear explosions from earthquakes as in previous testing treaties. The lower-magnitude threshold and increased reliance on regional observations assures that mining explosions will be detected by the monitoring system. It is important that the signals from mining explosions are properly identified to avoid false alarms of the monitoring system. Cooperation with the mining industry, including deployment of close-in instrumentation and extensive documentation of the explosions, provides critical information for interpreting the performance of regional discriminants. Linkage of these observations to appropriate physical models of the blasting process is also enhanced through this cooperative research effort. A number of discriminants for characterizing mining explosions have been identified including P to Lg ratios at high and low frequencies, surface wave to high-frequency body wave amplitudes, Rg at short distances, high- and low-frequency time-independent spectral modulations, signal correlation, and temporal clustering. Variable performance of individual discriminants results from such factors as mine-specific blasting practices and the complexity of the regional wave propagation. This variability attests to the need for a suite of region-specific discriminants. Regional calibration with modest-size, single-fired contained chemical explosions can provide a basis for developing region-specific procedures. Broadband data provide the basis for the most robust set of discriminants. The inclusion of infrasonic data as part of the IMS introduces a potential for the combined use of seismic and infrasonic data for the identification of near-surface explosions. The generation and, to a greater extent, the propagation of mining explosion infrasonic signals is not well understood, but empirical data attest to its future utility. Evidence for the accidental, near-simultaneous detonation of a large amount of explosives during standard delay-fired explosions is presented. Events such as these have single-fired characteristics and may prove to be problematic in discrimination analysis.},

This corrects for first-order attenuation structure, as well as near-receiver site effects and any errors in the instrument response functions. Using the earthquake spectra and a simple ω 2 source model, we compute an empirical Green’s function (EGF) to remove the trade-off between the source terms and other parameters in our model. A constant stress-drop model gives a good fit to the observed average earthquake spectra over a wide range of moment magnitude, but provides a mediocre fit to the average quarry blast spectra, which have a generally steeper fall-off at high frequencies than ω 2. We also compare P- and S-wave amplitudes and find modestly smaller average S amplitudes for the explosions compared to the earthquakes. For southern California, the root-mean-square (rms) misfit of P-wave spectra to an ω 2 source model is a more reliable explosion discriminant than the S-to-P amplitude ratio and works for about 90\% of the events.},

We used a dataset of seismic events in Utah recorded during a 14-day period (1–14 January 2011) by the University of Utah Seismic Stations network to perform a comparative study of event classification at local scale using amplitude ratio (AR) methods and a machine learning (ML) approach. The event catalog consists of 7377 events with magnitudes MC ranging from −2 and lower up to 5.8. Events were subdivided into six populations based on location and source type: tectonic earthquakes (TEs), mining-induced events (MIEs), and mining blasts from four known mines (WMB, SMB, LMB, and CQB). The AR approach jointly exploits Pg-to-Sg phase ARs and Rg-to-Sg spectral ARs in multivariate quadratic discriminant functions and was able to classify 370 events with high signal quality from the three groups with sufficient size (TE, MIE, and SMB). For that subset of the events, the method achieved success rates between about 80\% and 90\%. The ML approach used trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify the populations. The CNN approach was able to classify the subset of events with accuracies between about 91\% and 98\%. Because the neural network approach does not have a minimum signal quality requirement, we applied it to the entire event catalog, including the abundant extremely low-magnitude events, and achieved accuracies of about 94\%–100\%. We compare the AR and ML methodologies using a broad set of criteria and conclude that a major advantage to ML methods is their robustness to low signal-to-noise ratio data, allowing them to classify significantly smaller events.},

            Small-magnitude earthquakes shed light on the spatial and magnitude distribution of natural seismicity, as well as its rate and occurrence, especially in stable continental regions where natural seismicity remains difficult to explain under slow strain-rate conditions. However, capturing them in catalogs is strongly hindered by signal-to-noise ratio issues, resulting in high rates of false and man-made events also being detected. Accurate and robust discrimination of these events is critical for optimally detecting small earthquakes. This requires uncovering recurrent salient features that can rapidly distinguish first false events from real events, then earthquakes from man-made events (mainly quarry blasts), despite high signal variability and noise content. In this study, we combined the complementary strengths of human and interpretable rule-based machine-learning algorithms for solving this classification problem. We used human expert knowledge to co-create two reliable machine-learning classifiers through human-assisted selection of classification features and review of events with uncertain classifier predictions. The two classifiers are integrated into the SeisComP3 operational monitoring system. The first one discards false events from the set of events obtained with a low short-term average/long-term average threshold; the second one labels the remaining events as either earthquakes or quarry blasts. When run in an operational setting, the first classifier correctly detected more than 99\% of false events and just over 93\% of earthquakes; the second classifier correctly labeled 95\% of quarry blasts and 96\% of earthquakes. After a manual review of the second classifier low-confidence outputs, the final catalog contained fewer than 2\% of misclassified events. These results confirm that machine learning strengthens the quality of earthquake catalogs and that the performance of machine-learning classifiers can be improved through human expertise. Our study promotes a broader implication of hybrid intelligence monitoring within seismological observatories.},

Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large-magnitude events. Here, we show that with deep learning, we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand-labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body-wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases even when masked by high background noise and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that are not represented in the training set (in particular, very largemagnitude events). This generalized phase detection framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.},

            Earthquake signal detection and seismic phase picking are challenging tasks in the processing of noisy data and the monitoring of microearthquakes. Here we present a global deep-learning model for simultaneous earthquake detection and phase picking. Performing these two related tasks in tandem improves model performance in each individual task by combining information in phases and in the full waveform of earthquake signals by using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We show that our model outperforms previous deep-learning and traditional phase-picking and detection algorithms. Applying our model to 5 weeks of continuous data recorded during 2000 Tottori earthquakes in Japan, we were able to detect and locate two times more earthquakes using only a portion (less than 1/3) of seismic stations. Our model picks P and S phases with precision close to manual picks by human analysts; however, its high efficiency and higher sensitivity can result in detecting and characterizing more and smaller events.},

	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/, along with a demo at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org, and a video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},
